README FOR Linux::Cpuinfo
==========================

Linux::Cpuinfo is a module that provides an object oriented interface to
the /proc/cpuinfo on Linux systems.  This file contains information about
the CPU (or CPUs) in the computer which may be of use for diagnostic
purposes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

There are no other modules needed.  The only absolute dependency is that
there is a file that contains the same information as the /proc/cpuinfo
found on Linux systems with the 2.2.16 kernel with the procfs configured.

I would be delighted if this was found to work on other systems than Linux
and indeed if other OS do have a similar interface then I might be 
persuaded to include support for them in future releases.
